# Discord-Chatting-App-Clone
A chat application similar to Discord using C# .NET enables multiple users to communicate with each other in real-time.

The chat application consists of a command-line interface (CLI) and a client-side component. The command-line interface (CLI) tool provides detailed logs of user connections, disconnections, and messages sent, along with timestamps for each event, while the client-side component will provide a user interface for sending and receiving messages.
